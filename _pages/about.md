Hi! My name is Sofia. I am a PhD student at the University of California at Santa Barbara. Prior to that I was a <a href='https://perimeterinstitute.ca/psi-masters-program'>PSI Master's student</a> at the Perimeter Institute and the University of Waterloo, and a Bachelor's student at Imperial College London.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
