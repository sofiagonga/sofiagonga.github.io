Hi! My name is Sofia. I am a PhD student at the beautiful University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB). So far, I have been interested in tackling problems at the intersection of quantum information and condensed matter with the use of numerical techniques, such as tensor networks.<br>

Prior to my time at UCSB I was a <a href='https://perimeterinstitute.ca/psi-masters-program'>PSI Master's student</a> at the Perimeter Institute and the University of Waterloo, a student researcher at <a href='https://quantumai.google/'>Google Quantum AI</a> and a Bachelor's student at Imperial College London. Originally, I come from the beautiful town of <a href='https://www.spain.info/en/destination/zaragoza/'>Zaragoza</a> in Spain, where I grew up with amazing scenery, friends and family.<br>

I'm always up for a chat, excited about exploring new ideas and diving into projects. If anything I do resonates with you, feel free to get in touch â€“ I'd love to connect!
